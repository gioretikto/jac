<h2>USAGE</h2>

<p>This is an Infix Notation Calculator for the GNU/Linux Operating System (not a polish one) able to perform calculation such as:</p>

<pre>
tan(50+1)*3
</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>4+4.5-(34/(8*3-3))</pre>

<p>The syntax for other mathematical operator is the following</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>acos(x)  Returns the angle (0 to π radians) whose cosine is x</p></li>

	<li><p>asin(x)  Returns the angle (—π/2 to π/2 radians) whose sine is x</p></li>

	<li><p>atan(x)  Returns the angle (−π/2 to π/2 radians) whose tangent is x</p></li>

	<li><p>cos(x)  Returns the cosine of x (x in radians)</p></li>

	<li><p>sin(x)  Returns the sine of x (x in radians)</p></li>

	<li><p>tan(x)  Returns the tangent of x (x in radians)</p></li>

	<li><p>exp(x)  Returns the exponential function of x (e<sup>x</sup>)</p></li>

	<li><p>ln(x)  Returns the natural logarithm of x</p></li>

	<li><p>log(x)  Returns the base 10 logarithm of x</p></li>

	<li><p>sqrt(x)  Returns the square root of x</p></li>

</ul>
